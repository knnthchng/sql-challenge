Weekly challenge assignment for data analytics bootcamp: SQL.

### Assignment Background:
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

### Assignment/Repository Contents:

#### code
Directory contains .sql files containing code for creating the tables (database_schema.sql) and queries for retrieving specific data from this database (database_queries.sql)

#### data
Directory contains datasets imported into this database. Datasets are in .csv format.

#### relate_map
Directory contains images and documentation for mapping the relationships between tables and datasets in this database. Documentation PDF and schema SQL file were created using https://quickdatabasediagrams.com and a screenshot was taken of the final results.
